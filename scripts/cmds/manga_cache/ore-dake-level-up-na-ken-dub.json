To combat these vile beasts, ordinary people received superhuman powers and became known as \"Hunters.\" Twenty-year-old Sung Jin-Woo is one such Hunter, but he is known as the \"World's Weakest,\" owing to his pathetic power compared to even a measly E-Rank. Still, he hunts monsters tirelessly in low-rank Gates to pay for his mother's medical bills.\nHowever, this miserable lifestyle changes when Jin-Woo—believing himself to be the only one left to die in a mission gone terribly wrong—awakens in a hospital three days later to find a mysterious screen floating in front of him. This \"Quest Log\" demands that Jin-Woo completes an unrealistic and intense training program, or face an appropriate penalty. Initially reluctant to comply because of the quest's rigor, Jin-Woo soon finds that it may just transform him into one of the world's most fearsome Hunters.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","subOrDub":"dub","type":"WINTER 2024 ANIME","status":"Completed","otherName":"\n                          俺だけレベルアップな件 \n                           我獨自升級 \n                           나 혼자만 레벨업 \n                           Solo Leveling \n                           Na Honjaman Level Up \n                           I Level Up Alone \n                           โซโลเลเวลลิง\n                      ","episodes":[{"id":"ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-1","number":1,"url":"https://anitaku.so//ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-1"},{"id":"ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-2","number":2,"url":"https://anitaku.so//ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-2"},{"id":"ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-3","number":3,"url":"https://anitaku.so//ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-3"},{"id":"ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-4","number":4,"url":"https://anitaku.so//ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-4"},{"id":"ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-5","number":5,"url":"https://anitaku.so//ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-5"},{"id":"ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-6","number":6,"url":"https://anitaku.so//ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-6"},{"id":"ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-7","number":7,"url":"https://anitaku.so//ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-7"},{"id":"ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-8","number":8,"url":"https://anitaku.so//ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-8"},{"id":"ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-9","number":9,"url":"https://anitaku.so//ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-9"},{"id":"ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-10","number":10,"url":"https://anitaku.so//ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-10"},{"id":"ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-11","number":11,"url":"https://anitaku.so//ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-11"},{"id":"ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-12","number":12,"url":"https://anitaku.so//ore-dake-level-up-na-ken-dub-episode-12"}]}}
